## Understanding the circumstance

Udacity courses currently have two options on the home page: "start free trial", and "access course materials". In this option, Udacity concentrate the first option "start free trial". The process about this option is like this.

Udacity want to put a process which guide student, who have less time to take classes to choose "access course materials", after click "start free trial".

Using thie new process, Udacity want to reduce the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough time <**hypothesis**> and want to know it is practically effective or not.

## Experiment Design

### Metric Choice

-  Invariant metrics
  - As the upper image, I want to look at the data **after people click the "start free-trial"**, so data before people click the "start free-trial" can be invariant metrics.  
  - To make same size of control and experiment data, I have to make both's number of clicks similarly. Thus **Number of clicks** have to be invariant metric.
  - The **Unit of diversion** of this test is ""Cookie"", so I made this metric invariantly.
  - **Click-through-probability** is ( Number of clicks / Number of Cookies ). I already decide this two metrics to set invariant metrics. Therefore **Click-through-probability** have to be a invariant metric.
